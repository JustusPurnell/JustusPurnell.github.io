            <h3><a href="https://tarriverarms.com/" target="_blank">Tar River Arms</a></h3>
            <p>This site has a good design. It is very appealing it makes it easy for the user to navigate what they need.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses good contrast with light text on a dark background, making it easy to read. The navigation links and headings really pop out against the background, which helps make everything clear and easy to find.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There’s consistent repetition in the design. The same fonts and colors are used across the site, which gives it a clean and professional look. The color scheme and font choices don’t change, keeping everything looking the same throughout the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment is solid. Everything is centered, including the headings and text. This makes the page look organized and easy to follow. It’s clear that everything is placed intentionally, which makes the site look professional and neat.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The site follows the proximity principle well. Related items are grouped together, so it’s easy to understand what information goes together. There’s enough space between different sections, making it comfortable to read without feeling cluttered.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.granvillegunworksonline.com/" target="_blank">Granville Gun Works</a></h3>
            <p>This website seems very outdated. the countrast isn't the best which make it unappealing for the user.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The contrast is bad. The text blends into the background, especially on the flag. It’s hard to read, and the blue text on blue buttons doesn’t stand out at all.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The repetition is inconsistent. Some buttons look the same, but different fonts and colors are used all over the place, making it feel messy.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment is off. Things aren’t lined up right. The product images and text feel scattered, making it look disorganized.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The proximity is poor. Things that should be close, like product descriptions and buttons, are too far apart. The page feels overcrowded with too many ads and distractions.</li>
            </ul>
